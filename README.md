# acceptance tests

This repository contains all of the Pelias API "acceptance" tests, which are automated tests used to identify
improvements and regressions between various versions of the API and the underlying data. Since it's
difficult/impossible to manually verify whether things have begun silently failing (eg, a certain query stopped
returning the right results) after a data or search logic change, the acceptance tests should provide us with a
shotgun overview of the status of any Pelias instance.

## prerequisites

You will need to have `npm` version `2.0` or higher installed.

## Usage

```bash
# default to running all tests against production
npm test
# specify an environment manually
npm test -- -e bigdev
# specify an environment and only run tests that work against dev (small dataset of just NYC and London)
npm test -- -e dev -t dev
```
